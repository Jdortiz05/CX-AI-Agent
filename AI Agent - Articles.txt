✔️ Crypto accounts [/hc/en-us/articles/26418497334804-How-to-transfer-to-my-crypto-account]


✔️ Transfer to debit cards [/hc/en-us/articles/26417851606548-How-to-transfer-to-my-debit-card]




It all depends on the level of convenience you want. We take care of sending the money at your fingertips.


 




ONTOP FEES 💸


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here you'll find all the information about potential withdrawal fees! We want you to feel confident when making transactions with
your compensation.




 




HOW DO FEES WORK AND WHY ARE THEY GENERATED? 🤔


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These are determined monetary amounts charged by banks or platforms, as they facilitate the transfer of money to any account or
location worldwide. Your bank or the government may charge these fees for facilitating the transfer of money, and this is a
commission they always have for international transfers.




TRANSFER FEE 💳


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This cost refers to the charges applied per transaction to send money globally.




EXCHANGE RATE 💱


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The relative price of one currency in terms of another. In this case, you'll see that it's not necessarily the same as Google or
the market. Ontop must consider the risk of transferring to local currencies.


The value of these indicators varies depending on the country and currency where you're transferring your money.


 


Below, you'll find a more detailed description for each payment method 👇


✔️ Payoneer 💼


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Payoneer is a global payment service that makes it possible to receive money from other people and companies around the world. It
works as if you had a local bank account in those countries, making transfers cheap and fast. The fee for transferring to Payoneer
is 1 USD + 0.5%.


 


✔️ Crypto 🌐


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a form of money that allows individuals to transfer value in a secure environment thanks to the
use of cryptography, hence its name. At first glance, you might think that it works the same as PayPal or other banking
applications. In general, they can be used for the same use cases – making transfers or online purchases – but if a more detailed
analysis is carried out, we find fundamental differences. They work like banks, for transfers, specific networks for
cryptocurrencies are used, which depending on how much they are used, charge a certain commission on your payment.


 * Currently, the fee generated on the ERC-20 and BEP-20 network is from 1.2%+ Network Fee.
 * Transfers to crypto wallets can take from 10 minutes to 6 hours to arrive.


 


✔️ Debit Cards 💳


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you want to send a transfer to a debit card, we want to inform you that the only countries that have this option available are:


 * El Salvador (accepts only VISA cards)
 * Honduras (accepts only VISA cards)
 * Dominican Republic (accepts only VISA cards)
 * Nicaragua (accepts VISA and Mastercard cards)
 * Philippines (accepts VISA and Mastercard cards)
 * Peru (accepts only VISA cards)


The corresponding fee for sending transfers to debit cards is 2% of the total transferred.


 


✔️ Bank Accounts 🏦


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These may vary depending on the bank and the configuration of the bank account. For example, for international transactions, the
fee or commission may be higher. You can check the fee table where costs for some countries are specified.


International bank transfers


The fees associated with international transfers are 2:


 * The first is because the bank may need an intermediary to send the payment to the beneficiary bank (if necessary, it normally
   charges 20 USD).
 * The second possible fee is one that the beneficiary bank charges for receiving an international transfer (It can be charged
   from 0 to 25 USD)

 * Updated






Thinking of topping up your card and wondering if there are any limits? Here's everything you need to know about top-ups made
through your Ontop virtual wallet.




 




💳 WHAT IS THE PER TOP-UP LIMIT?


You can top up up to USD 1,000 per transaction. If you need to add more funds, you can simply make multiple top-ups.


> Important: There’s no limit to the number of top-ups you can make, but a monthly total limit does apply (see below).




 




📅 IS THERE A MONTHLY LIMIT?


Yes. The maximum total top-up amount allowed per month is USD 10,000. This applies regardless of how many transactions you make
during the month.




 




💰 WHAT IS THE MINIMUM TOP-UP AMOUNT?


The minimum amount allowed for a single top-up is USD 1. Make sure your transaction meets or exceeds this amount.




 




🔄 CAN I USE A METHOD OTHER THAN THE ONTOP VIRTUAL WALLET TO TOP UP?


Currently, top-ups can only be made through the Ontop virtual wallet. Other payment methods are not supported at this time.




 




💳 TRANSACTION AND WITHDRAWAL LIMITS


Limit Daily Weekly Monthly Per Transaction Number of Purchases 60 420 1800 - Total Purchase Amount USD 4,500.00 USD 4,500.00 USD
9,999.00 USD 4,500.00 Number of ATM Withdrawals 10 35 140 - Total ATM Withdrawal Amount USD 2,000.00 USD 5,000.00 USD 9,999.00 USD
1,000.00 Total Top-Up Limit - - USD 10,000.00 USD 1,000.00




 




IMPORTANT NOTES


 * Monthly limits are reset on the 1st day of each month.
 * Purchase and withdrawal limits are in place to protect your funds from fraud.
